# SATB.ninja

## https://SATB.ninja

SATB.ninja is a chord display and interpreter tool. It is using the WebMIDI API that had become recently available in most browsers, making it possible to create such apps on the web.

It is absolutely a pet-project, putting together two of my passions: coding and music. By writing this app I'm hoping to get better at sight-reading music and counterpoint, and if a somewhat useful tool is created in the meantime, it's for the better.
