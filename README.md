# [SATB.ninja](https://SATB.ninja){target="_blank"}

SATB.ninja is a chord display and interpreter tool. It is using the WebMIDI API that had become recently available in most browsers, making it possible to create such apps on the web.

It is a pet-project, putting together two of my passions: coding and music. By writing this app I'm hoping to get better at sight-reading sheet-music and at counterpoint. If a somewhat useful tool emerges from it, it's for the better.
